    Rest cleint: Retrofit is used.Retrofit is a REST Client for Java and Android. It makes it relatively easy to retrieve and
    upload JSON (or other structured data) via a REST based webservice. In Retrofit you configure which converter is used for
    the data serialization. Typically for JSON you use GSon, but you can add custom converters to process XML or other protocols.
    Retrofit uses the OkHttp library for HTTP requests.
     Retrofit need:
    Model class which is used as a JSON model
    Interfaces that define the possible HTTP operations
    Retrofit.Builder class - Instance which uses the interface and the Builder API to allow defining the URL end point for the HTTP operations.

    Every method of an interface represents one possible API call. It must have a HTTP annotation (GET, POST, etc.) to specify 
   the request type and the relative URL. The return value wraps the response in a Call object with the type of the expected
   result.
